1. DesignofExperiment.Rmd
Purpose: This file details the process of creating a D-efficient design for the choice experiment.

2. HCM.Rmd
Purpose: This file covers the data cleaning, analysis, and modeling aspects (conditional logit and mixed logit model) of the choice experiment.

Note: Ensure that all necessary packages or libraries are installed before running the code. You need an older version to run the mixed logit model.
